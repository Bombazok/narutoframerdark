I've merged two VS Code themes - one is the "Dark" by Thomaz with identifier "thomaz.preparing" at the extensions marketplace and the other one (which I used for syntax higlight) is "Framer Dark" from Base16 Theme Generator extension by Sanders Lauture with identifier "golf1052.base16-generator". I have no any rights to both of the source extensions, I just created this extensions for personal use at different devices and maybe somebody will find this theme pretty - you're welcome.
